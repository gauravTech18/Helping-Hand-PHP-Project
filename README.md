A donation is a gift for charity, humanitarian aid, or to benefit a cause. A donation may take various forms, including money, alms, services, or goods such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles. A donation may satisfy medical needs such as blood or organs for transplant.
Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) projects can range from environmental interventions to literacy programs. The goal of such projects is usually to improve standards of living and quality of life in a region.
